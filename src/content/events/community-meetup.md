Our monthly meetup is a low-key space to connect with other LGBTQ folks and allies. No agenda—just conversation, snacks, and community.

**What to expect:**

- A welcoming, casual environment
- Optional name tags and icebreakers
- Space to share or just listen
- Info about upcoming programs

All ages welcome. We'll have a quiet corner for anyone who needs a break from the crowd.

**No RSVP required**, but [let us know](/contact) if you're coming so we can plan snacks!
