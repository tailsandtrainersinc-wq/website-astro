The Saturday fursuit parade is one of the most anticipated events of Texas Furry Fiesta. Dozens of fursuiters march through the hotel lobby and convention space while photographers and spectators line the route.

**Open to all suiters** — handlers are encouraged. Water and cool-down areas will be available nearby.

Meet at the designated staging area by 1:30 PM for lineup.
