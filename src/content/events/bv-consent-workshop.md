Consent isn't just a checkbox — it's an ongoing, evolving conversation. This workshop goes beyond the basics to explore how we build consent culture in our scenes, relationships, and communities.

## Topics

- The spectrum of consent: enthusiastic, informed, ongoing
- Negotiation frameworks that actually work
- Recognizing and responding to freeze responses
- Power dynamics and consent in D/s relationships
- Community accountability and bystander intervention

Open to all experience levels. Bring your questions — this is a discussion, not a lecture.
