We advocate for LGBTQ rights, visibility, and dignity in our communities and beyond. Our work is rooted in education and partnership, not division.

## Our Approach

- **Informed advocacy** — We share accurate information and resources so that others can speak up with confidence.
- **Outreach** — We connect with schools, workplaces, and civic groups to promote inclusive policies and practices.
- **Partnerships** — We collaborate with other nonprofits, advocates, and allies to amplify our impact.

## Get Involved

Advocacy can mean many things: signing a petition, attending a meeting, sharing a resource, or simply being a visible ally. Every voice matters.
