Everyone deserves to be in spaces where they can be themselves. We work to create and support environments that are explicitly welcoming and safe for LGBTQ people.

## What Safe Spaces Mean to Us

A safe space is one where:

- People are respected regardless of identity or expression.
- Bullying, harassment, and discrimination are not tolerated.
- Confidentiality and boundaries are honored.
- Learning and growth are encouraged.

## How We Help

We offer guidance and resources for organizations, schools, and groups that want to become safer and more affirming. We also host and promote events and programs that are designed as safe spaces from the ground up.
