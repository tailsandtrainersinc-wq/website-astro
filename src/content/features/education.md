Education is at the heart of our mission. We believe that understanding and awareness create safer, more inclusive spaces for everyone.

## What We Offer

- **Workshops** — Interactive sessions on LGBTQ history, terminology, allyship, and creating affirming environments.
- **Resources** — Curated guides, reading lists, and toolkits for educators, organizations, and families.
- **Programs** — Ongoing learning opportunities that build knowledge and connection over time.

## Why It Matters

When people have access to accurate, respectful information, they can better support LGBTQ individuals and challenge misinformation. Our education work helps build a world where everyone can learn, grow, and belong.
