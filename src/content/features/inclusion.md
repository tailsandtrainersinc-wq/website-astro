Inclusion isn't a buzzword for us — it's a practice. We center the diversity of LGBTQ experiences, including race, disability, age, and more, so our programs truly serve our whole community.

## Our Commitment

- **Intersectionality** — We recognize that identity is multifaceted and that many people face multiple forms of marginalization.
- **Access** — We work to make our programs accessible in terms of location, cost, language, and ability.
- **Listening** — We regularly seek feedback from the people we serve and adapt our work accordingly.

## Everyone Has a Place

If you've ever felt left out of LGBTQ spaces or programs, we want to change that. Our goal is a community where everyone can see themselves reflected and welcomed.
